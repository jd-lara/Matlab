1. Check max and min of the demand time serie. There cannot be zero values.
Action: In case there are zero values, I am replacing that point (hour and day) with the average of the previous and following 10 days. 

2. If there are simulation with strange values, one can check wehther the same result holds running the problematic simulation independently. I have been able to debug several mistakes in this way.
